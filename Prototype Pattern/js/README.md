# Prototype Pattern (JavaScript)

This folder contains a simple JavaScript implementation of the Prototype Pattern.

How to run:

```powershell
node index.js

Notes:
- Uses JSON-based deep clone for plain data structures. For production, prefer `structuredClone` or `lodash.cloneDeep` for complex types.

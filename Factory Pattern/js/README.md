The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created. It allows you to encapsulate the object creation logic and provide a common interface to create various types of objects.

we can implement the Factory Pattern using functions and object literals. Let's go through a step-by-step example:

Step 1: Define the Product Interface
First, define an interface or a blueprint that represents the common properties and methods that all products will have.

Step 2: Implement Concrete Products
Next, create concrete product functions that will be used to create objects of different types. These functions represent different types of products that the factory can produce.

Step 3: Create the Factory
Now, let's create a factory function that encapsulates the object creation logic. The factory function provides a method to create different products based on certain criteria.

Step 4: Using the Factory
Finally, you can use the factory to create instances of different products without directly instantiating the concrete functions.

By using the Factory Pattern, you can create products without exposing the concrete functions and their instantiation logic. This provides a more flexible and maintainable codebase, especially when you need to introduce new product types in the future. The factory encapsulates the object creation complexity and allows you to focus on the product's behavior and functionality.

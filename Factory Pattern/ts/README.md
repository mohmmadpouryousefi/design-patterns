The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created. It allows you to encapsulate the object creation logic and provide a common interface to create various types of objects.

In TypeScript, we can implement the Factory Pattern using classes and interfaces. Let's go through a step-by-step example:

Step 1: Define the Product Interface
First, define an interface that represents the common properties and methods that all products will have. This interface acts as a blueprint for the products created by the factory.

Step 2: Implement Concrete Products
Next, create concrete classes that implement the Product interface. These classes represent different types of products that the factory can produce.

Step 3: Create the Factory
Now, let's create the Factory class that encapsulates the object creation logic. The Factory class provides a method to create different products based on certain criteria.

Step 4: Using the Factory
Finally, you can use the factory to create instances of different products without directly instantiating the concrete classes.

By using the Factory Pattern, you can create products without exposing the concrete classes and their instantiation logic. This provides a more flexible and maintainable codebase, especially when you need to introduce new product types in the future. The factory encapsulates the object creation complexity and allows you to focus on the product's behavior and functionality.

The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, making them compatible without changing their existing code. This pattern is especially useful when you have a legacy system or a third-party library that you want to integrate with your codebase without modifying its code.

In the example, we created an AudioPlayer class, which internally holds instances of both the OldAudioPlayer and NewAudioPlayer. The AudioPlayer class acts as an adapter between these two classes and provides a common play() method.

The play() method takes a filename as input and determines the type of audio file based on its extension. If it's an .mp3 file, it delegates the playback to the OldAudioPlayer, and if it's an .mp4 file, it delegates the playback to the NewAudioPlayer. If the file has an unsupported format, it displays an error message.

The Adapter Pattern helps us achieve compatibility and reusability by providing a common interface for different classes or systems with incompatible interfaces. It allows us to integrate new functionality with the existing codebase smoothly, without introducing breaking changes.

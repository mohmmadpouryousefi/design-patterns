# Singleton Pattern

The Singleton Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is useful when you need exactly one instance of a class to coordinate actions across the system, such as managing a database connection, logging service, or configuration settings.

1. First, let's define the Singleton class. The constructor should be private (or protected in some languages) to prevent direct instantiation from outside the class:

2. Next, we'll create a static method getInstance() that returns the single instance of the class. This method will create the instance if it doesn't exist, or return the existing instance:

3. Now, let's use the Singleton to get the instance and demonstrate that multiple calls return the same instance

The Singleton Pattern ensures that only one instance of a class exists throughout the application lifecycle. It provides a global access point to that instance, making it useful for managing shared resources like database connections, caches, or configuration objects. However, use it carefully as it can make testing difficult and may introduce global state issues.

The Singleton Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. In JavaScript, we can implement the Singleton Pattern using various approaches including constructor functions, closures, or ES6 classes.

Let's go through a step-by-step example using ES6 classes:

Step 1: Define the Singleton Class
First, create a class that maintains a single instance and prevents direct instantiation by controlling the constructor behavior.

Step 2: Implement the getInstance Method  
Create a static method that manages the single instance creation and returns the same instance on subsequent calls.

Step 3: Use the Singleton
Demonstrate that multiple calls to get the instance return the same object, ensuring only one instance exists throughout the application lifecycle.

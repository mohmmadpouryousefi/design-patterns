The Singleton Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. In TypeScript, we can implement the Singleton Pattern using classes with private constructors and static methods, providing strong type safety and compile-time checks.

Let's go through a step-by-step example using TypeScript classes:

Step 1: Define the Singleton Class
First, create a class with a private constructor to prevent direct instantiation from outside the class. Use a private static property to hold the single instance.

Step 2: Implement the getInstance Method
Create a public static method that manages the single instance creation and returns the same instance on subsequent calls, with proper TypeScript typing.

Step 3: Use the Singleton
Demonstrate that multiple calls to get the instance return the same object, and show how TypeScript prevents direct instantiation through compile-time checking.

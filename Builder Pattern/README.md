# Builder Pattern

The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. It is useful when you have an object with many optional properties, and you want to construct it step by step with a clear API.


steps:<br/> 
1. First, let's define the complex object we want to build. For the example, we'll create a Car class with several optional properties:

2. Next, we'll create the Builder class. The Builder class will have methods to set each optional property of the Car and a final build() method to construct the Car object:

3. Now, let's use the Builder to construct a Car object

The Builder Pattern allows you to construct complex objects without exposing their internal details. It provides a clear and readable API for constructing objects with many optional properties, making the code more maintainable and easier to use.

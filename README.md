# Design Patterns in JavaScript and TypeScript<br/>
This repository contains examples and explanations of various design patterns implemented in JavaScript and TypeScript. Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. Understanding and applying design patterns can lead to more maintainable, scalable, and reusable code.<br/>

## Design Patterns Categories<br/>

Creational Patterns:

Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, abstracting the process of object instantiation. They allow flexibility in creating objects without exposing the underlying creation logic. 

Structural Patterns:

Structural patterns focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. They help in defining relationships between objects, making it easier to compose and modify structures.

Behavioral Patterns:

Behavioral patterns deal with communication and interaction between objects, focusing on how objects collaborate and distribute responsibilities. They improve the flexibility and efficiency of communication. 

In this repository, you'll find implementations of the following design patterns in JavaScript and TypeScript:<br/>
<br/>
Singleton Pattern<br/>
Factory Pattern<br/>
Observer Pattern<br/>
Strategy Pattern<br/>
Decorator Pattern<br/>
Command Pattern<br/>
Proxy Pattern<br/>
Adapter Pattern<br/>
and more...<br/>
Each design pattern comes with detailed explanations, code examples to help you understand the pattern's purpose, structure, and usage.<br/>

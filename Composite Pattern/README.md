# Composite Pattern

The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. This pattern is useful when you want to represent a hierarchy of objects in a way that allows treating individual objects and groups of objects in a uniform manner.

In the Composite Pattern, there are two main components:

1. Leaf: This represents individual objects in the composition. It implements the Component interface.

2. Composite: This represents a group of objects. It also implements the Component interface but can contain a collection of other components (leaves or composites).


In the implementations, we have a Component interface representing both leaf and composite objects. The Leaf class represents individual objects, and the Composite class represents a group of objects. The Composite class can contain other components (leaves or composites) and can treat them uniformly. The operation() method is called on both leaf and composite objects, providing a consistent way to perform operations in the entire hierarchy.

# Abstract Factory Pattern

Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It allows the client code to create objects without being aware of their underlying implementations, promoting loose coupling between the client and the objects it uses.

# implementation

Suppose we want to create different types of cars: ElectricCar and GasolineCar, and for each type of car, we need to create cars of different brands: Tesla and Toyota.

Step 1: Define the Car interface and its concrete implementations (ElectricCar and GasolineCar).

Step 2: Define the CarFactory interface with methods to create instances of ElectricCar and GasolineCar.

Step 3: Implement concrete factories that extend the CarFactory and create specific types of cars.

Step 4: Use the Abstract Factory to create objects without being aware of their concrete classes.

In the example, the Abstract Factory Pattern allows us to create different types of cars without knowing their specific implementations. The client code can easily switch between different car brands by using the appropriate concrete factory, promoting flexibility and maintainability in the codebase.

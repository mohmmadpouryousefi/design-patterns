# Flyweight Pattern

The Flyweight Pattern is a structural design pattern that reduces memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects â€” called flyweights. It separates intrinsic (shared) state from extrinsic (contextual) state so a large number of fine-grained objects can be supported efficiently.

This directory contains JavaScript and TypeScript examples demonstrating a particle system where particle types are shared (flyweights) and position/velocity are extrinsic.

See `js` and `ts` subfolders for runnable examples and instructions.
